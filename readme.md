## CoffeeScript

### A rubyish-pythonesque-javascriptish language that compiles to javascript. Basically it makes your code less verbose.

Functions can be created rubyishly: 
> square = (x) -> x * x

Great features for making functions with arbitrary-length argument list:
> awardMedals = (first, second, others...) ->
    //do stuff with the arguments!

Gotta love awesome pythonic list comprehensions
> eat food for food in ['toast', 'cheese', 'wine']

> countdown = (num for num in [10..1])

Cool array slicing features
> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  start   = numbers[0..2]

It also has classes, inheritance and super

And more... (which is my way of saying that I'm running out of time and need some more hands on this)
